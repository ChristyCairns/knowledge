<li>For a proper use, the nozzle movement must be parallel to the Hotbed
    Surface.</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve that, there are three screws available to calibrate its
orientation. There’s a risk of the nozzle hitting the hotbed glass or
the first layer not sticking on its surface when decalibrated. The
following steps must be followed:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Click Autohome (Prepare/Autohome) so the printer axes move to
    their initial position. The first time, caution should be exercised
    because the nozzle can collide with the base plate. If it is
    anticipated that this will happen, manually press the Z axis end
    stopper.</li>
<li>2. Adjust the screw triggering the endstop so the nozzle almost
    touches the glass when clicking Auto-home.</li>
<li>3. Tighten or loosen the three black screws levelling the base
    plate. The distance between the nozzle and the glass should be 0,2
    mm. (Tip: use a folded paper to check)</li>
<li>4. Position the extruder in the left side using your hand (in case
    any resistance is felt, disable the stepper motors using Prepare >
    DisableSteppers). Level the base plate once again using the same
    procedure.</li>
<li>5. Move the base plate to the front to level the rear end of the
    plate.</li>
<li>6. Repeat the process until its four corners are levelled.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="load-filament">Load Filament<a class="headerlink" href="#load-filament" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>1. Heat the extruder. Warm the hotend up to printing temperature.
    It is not necessary to click on Preheat, although it is advisable
    when wanting to print immediately after loading the spool. If that
    is not the case, click Menú>Control>Temperatura>Nozzle>220ºC.</li>
<li>2. Click on Prepare>Move axis> 1mm>Extruder, and rotate the
    wheel slightly clockwise (positive values) to extrude a few
    millimeters of material. This procedure will help prevent jams.</li>
<li>3. Click on Prepare>Move axis> 1mm>Extruder, and rotate the
    wheel anticlockwise (negative values) moving the gear a few steps
    back until the filament is free.</li>
<li>4. Once the old thread is out, load the new one. Click on
    Prepare>Move axis> 1mm>Extruder so the screws hold it tight .
    Move the wire slowly until the material exits trough the end of the
    hotend.</li>
<li>5. For a proper filament feeding, the idler screws must be
    tightened enough, offering a slight resistance when assisted with
    our fingers.</li>
<li>6. Once the extruder starts pulling the filament, tighten the
    screws until enough pressure is reached.</li>
<li>7. Once these steps are followed, the filament will be loaded and
    ready to print.</li>

<h2 id="pla">PLA<a class="headerlink" href="#pla" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>-
PLA (polylactic acid) is the quintessential material for 3d printing,
thanks to its ease of use through deposition. It is recommended to begin
in this type of manufacturing technology with this material. A great
variety of colors exists and complex geometries can be achived without
great difficulty. The finish is slightly glossy or semi-matte. Printing
is carried out at temperatures ranging between 195º and 220° C,
depending on the supplier of the mate­rial and printing speed. A layer
fan is required to build overhangs. It easily attaches to the glass, and
if you work at a hotbed temperature ranging 45º C-55º C, no product is
requiered to ensure this adherence. The mechanical properties are
average, but presents a certain fragility in parts requiring
deformation, from a tempe­rature of about 50 °, the parts can present
it. It is dissolved in caustic soda.</p>
<h2 id="abs">ABS<a class="headerlink" href="#abs" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>-
ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) is one of the most widely used
materials in 3d printing, and makes up for some of the weaknesses of the
PLA. Printing with ABS is more complex and requires some attention. ABS
is not recom­mended for inexperienced users. The variety of colors is
also very high and the finish is semi-matte or matte. The ABS is printed
at temperatures between 210º C and 240º C depending on the supplier of
the material and prin­ting speed. The ABS performs better with
overhangs, and needs less air into the fan layer (excess air can be
harmful). Adherence to the platform is weaker than with the PLA, due to
material shrinkage on cooling, and often requires adhesive coating
despite working with a hotbed temperature of 70 ° C. If the geometry of
the piece to be printed has a too large base, is further promotes
adherence problem due to the large lift effect that occurs at the
oppopsite ends of the workpiece (known as warping).</p>
<h2 id="filaflex">Filaflex<a class="headerlink" href="#filaflex" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>-
Filaflex is a flexible material that comes in different colours.
Requires the use of a 0.6 mm nozzle. Speed 10mm/s Temperature 235ºC
Hodbed 40ºC</p>

<p>-
Basic settings are the general settings that you usually want to change.
These settings have the most impact on the result</p>
<p>Nozzle size: The size of the hole in your nozzle. The FabLab uses 0.4mm
nozzle by default, and 0.6 for faster printing or filaflex.</p>
<p>Layer height: The height of each layer. For print quality and printing
time this is the most important setting. Usual settings are 0.2mm for a
low quality print. 0.1mm for a medium quality print. 0.06mm for a high
quality print.</p>
<p>Shell thickness: The thickness of the side shells, it has to be multiple
of nozzle size number.</p>
<p>Bottom/top thickness: The bottom/top thickness is the outer shell
thickness on the top and bottom. it has to be multiple of layer height
number</p>
<p>Fill density: Cura fills the internal parts of your model with a
structure. This grid is made for strength and to support the top layers.
The amount of infill you want is influenced by this setting.</p>
<p>Print speed: Print speed sets the speed at which the print is put down.
The default of 50mm per second.</p>
<p>Print temperature: The print temperature is the temperature at which you
print. if you want to print faster you might need to increase the
temperature.210 for PLA and 240 for ABS.</p>
<p>Support type: Supports are structures printed below the print to support
parts that otherwise would be unprintable. There are 2 options here,
support structures that need to touch the build platform, or support
structures that can also touch the top of your model. You can modifie
some aspects in(…)</p>
<p>Platform adhesion type: The platform adhesion type is a setting to help
the printed object stick on the printer bed. Large flat objects might
get lose from the printer bed because of an effect called warping. There
is the option to use a raft, which is a thick grid under the object
which scars the bottom of your print. Or a brim, which are lines around
the bottom of your object and because of the larger area the corners are
kept down. Brim usually gives the best results here as it does not scare
the object. But it requires more room on the printer bed.</p>
<p>Filament diameter: The filament diameter is the diameter of your
filament. Reprap uses 2.9mm.</p>
<p>Filament flow: The filament flow is a correction factor to make
extrusion higher or lower than usual. Some systems or materials require
a correction next to the usual diameter setting. This flow adjustment
can be used for this.</p>
