<p>KUKA|prc is a set of Grasshopper components that provide Procedural
Robot Control for KUKA robots (thus the name PRC). These components are
very straightforward to use and it's actually quite easy to program the
robots using them.</p>
<h3 id="rhino-file-setup">Rhino File Setup<a class="headerlink" href="#rhino-file-setup" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>When you work with the robots using KUKA|prc your units in Rhino must be
configured for the Metric system using millimetres. The easiest way to
do this is to use the pull-down menus and select File > New... then
from the dialogue presented chose "Small Objects - Millimeters" as your
template. - Orientation Axes: The other joints (4, 5, 6). These joints
are always rotary. Pitch / Roll / Yaw = Orientation Axes. These are the
axes closer to the tool.</p>
<p>When installing KUKA|prc has a user interface (UI) much like other
Grasshopper plug-ins. The UI consists of the palettes in the KUKA|prc
menu.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/assets/images/kuka_prc_GRASSHOPPER_plugin.jpg" title="File:kuka prc GRASSHOPPER plugin.jpg" /></p>
<p>There are five palettes which organize the components. These are:</p>
<p>01 | Core: The main Core component is here (discussed below). There are
also the components for the motion types (linear, spline, etc.).</p>
<p>02 | Virtual Robot: The various KUKA robots are here. We'll mostly be
using the KUKA gelis KR6-10 R900 component as those are what are used in
the Agilus work cell.</p>
<p>03 | Virtual Tools: Approach and Retract components are here (these
determine how the robot should move after a toolpath has completed).
There are also components for dividing up curves and surfaces and
generating robotic motion based on that division.</p>
<p>04 | Toolpath Utilities: The tools (end effectors) are here. We'll
mostly be using the Custom Tool component.</p>
<p>05 | Utilities: The components dealing with input and outputs are stored
here. These will be discussed later.</p>
<h3 id="kukaprc-core">KUKA|prc CORE<a class="headerlink" href="#kukaprc-core" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>The component you always use in every definition is called the Core. It
is what generates the KUKA Robot Language (KRL) code that runs on the
robot. It also provides the graphical simulation of the robot motion
inside Rhino. Everything else gets wired into this component.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/assets/images/Kuka_prc_Core.jpg" title="File:Kuka prc Core.jpg" /></p>
<p>The Core component takes five inputs. These are:</p>
<p>SIM- This is a numeric value. Attach a default slider with values from
0.00 to 1.00 to control the simulation.</p>
<p>CMDS- This is the output of one of the KUKA|prc Command components. For
example a Linear motion command could be wired into this socket.</p>
<p>TOOL- This is the tool (end effector) to use. It gets wired from one of
the Tool components available in the Virtual Tools panel. Usually,
you'll use the KUKA|prc Custom Tool option and wire in a Mesh component
will show the tool geometry in the simulation.</p>
<p>ROBOT - This is the robot to use. The code will be generated for this
robot and the simulation will graphically depict this robot. You'll wire
in one of the robots from the Virtual Robot panel. For the Agilus
Workcell, you'll use the Agilus KR6-10 R900 component.</p>
<p>COLLISION - This is an optional series of meshes that define collision
geometry. Enable collision checking in the KUKA|prc settings to make use
of this. Note that collision checking has a large, negative impact on
KUKA|prc performance.</p>
<p>There are two output as well:</p>
<p>GEO: This is the geometry of the robot at the current position - as a
set of meshes. You can right-click on this socket and choose Bake to
generate a mesh version of the robot for any position in the simulation.
You can use this for renderings for example.</p>
<p>ANALYSIS: This provides a detailed analysis of the simulation values.
This has to be enabled for anything to appear. You enable it in the
Settings dialogue, Advanced page, Output Analysis Values checkbox. Then
use the Analysis component from the Utilities panel. For example, if you
wire a Panel component into the Axis Values socket you'll see all the
axis values for each command that's run.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/assets/images/kuka_prc_Analysis.jpg" title="File:kuka prc_Analysis.jpg" /></p>
<h3 id="settings">Settings<a class="headerlink" href="#settings" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>The grey KUKA|prc Settings label at the bottom of the Core component
gives you access to its settings. Simply left click on the label and the
dialog will appear.</p>
<p>The settings are organized into pages which you select from along the
top edge of the dialog (Settings, Advanced, and Analysis). The dialog is
modeless which means you can operate Rhino while it is open. To see the
effect of your changes in the viewport click the Apply button. These
settings will be covered in more detail later.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/assets/images/kuka_prc_Settings1.jpg" title="File:kuka prc_Settings1.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Basic Setup</strong> There is a common set of components used in nearly all
definitions for use with the Agilus Workcell. Not surprisingly, these
correspond to the inputs on the Core component. Here is a very typical
setup:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/assets/images/kuka_prc_BasicSetup2.jpg" title="File:kuka prc_BasicSetup2.jpg" /></p>
<p>SIM SLIDER: The simulation Slider goes from 0.000 to 1.000. Dragging it
moves the robot through all the motion specified by the Command input.
It's often handy to drag the right edge of this slider to make it much
wider than the default size. This gives you greater control when you
scrub to watch the simulation. You may also want to increase the
precision from a single decimal point to several (say 3 or 4). Without
that precision, you may not be able to scrub to all the points you want
to visualize the motion going through.</p>
<p>You can also add a Play/Pause component. This lets you simulate without
dragging the time slider.</p>
<p>CMDS: The components which get wired into the CMDS slot of the Core is
really the heart of your definition and will obviously depend on what
you are intending the robot to do. In the example above a simple Linear
Move, the component is wired in.</p>
<p>TOOL: We normally use custom tools with the Agilus Workcell. Therefore a
Mesh component gets wired into the KUKA|prc Custom Tool component
(labelled TOOL above). This gets wired into the TOOL slot of the Core.
The Mesh component points to a mesh representation of the tool drawn in
the Rhino file. See the section below on Tool orientation and
configuration.</p>
<p>ROBOT: The robots we have in the Agilus Workcell are KUKA KR6 R900s. So
that component is chosen to form the Virtual Robots panel. It gets wired
into the ROBOT slot of the Core.</p>
<p>COLLISION: If you want to check for collisions between the robot and the
work cell (table) wire in the meshes which represent the work cell. As
noted above this has a large negative impact on performance so use this
only when necessary.</p>
<h3 id="robot-position-and-orientation">Robot Position and Orientation<a class="headerlink" href="#robot-position-and-orientation" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p><img alt="" src="/assets/images/kuka_prc_Workcell.jpg" title="File:kuka prc_Workcell.jpg" /></p>
<p>The Agilus workcell has two robots named Mitey and Titey. Depending on
which one you are using you'll need to set up some parameters so your
simulation functions correctly. These parameters specify the location
and orientation of the robot within the workcell 3D model.</p>
<p>Note: The latest revision of Kuka|prc contains a custom robot for the
Agilus workcell. It has two output sockets, Mitey and Titey. Simply wire
in the robot you intend to use and no more configuration is required.</p>
<p>If you don't have the latest version, see below for how to set them up.</p>
<p>MITEY</p>
<p>Mitey is the name of the robot mounted in the table. Its base is at
0,0,0. The robot is rotated about its vertical axis 180 degrees. That
is, the cable connections are on the right side of the robot base as you
face the front of the workcell.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/assets/images/kuka_prc_MiteyTiteyComp2.jpg" title="File:kuka prc_MiteyTiteyComp2.jpg" /></p>
<p>To set up Mitey do the following:</p>
<p>Bring up the Settings dialog by left clicking on KUKA|prc Settings label
on the Core component. The dialog presented is shown below:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/assets/images/kuka_prc_BaseSetup.jpg" title="File:kuka prc_BaseSetup.jpg" /></p>
<p>You specify the X, Y, and Z offsets in the Base X, Base Y, and Base
Zdialogues of the dialog. Again, for Mitey these should all be 0. In
order to rotate the robot around the vertical axis you specify 180 in
the Base A field. You can see that the A axis corresponds to vertical in
the diagram.</p>
<p>Base X: 0 Base Y: 0 Base Z: 0 Base A: 180 Base B: 0 Base C: 0</p>
<p>After you hit Apply the robot position will be shown in the viewport.
You can close the dialog with the Exit button in the upper right corner.</p>
<p>TITEY</p>
<p>The upper robot hanging from the fixture is named Titey. It has a
different X, Y and Z offset values and rotations. Use the settings below
when your definition should run on Titey.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/assets/images/BaseSetup2.jpg" title="File:BaseSetup2.jpg" /></p>
<p>Note: These values are all in millimetres. Base X: 1102.5 Base Y: 0 Base
Z: 1125.6 Base A: 90 Base B: 180 Base C: 0</p>
<h3 id="code-output">Code Output<a class="headerlink" href="#code-output" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>The purpose of KUKA|prc is to generate the code which runs on the robot
controller. This code is usually in the Kuka Robot Language (KRL). You
need to tell KUKA|prc what directory and file name to use for its code
output. Once you've done this, as you make changes in the UI, the output
will be re-written as necessary to keep the code up to date with the
Grasshopper definition.</p>
<p>To set the output directory and file name follow these steps: Bring up
the Settings dialogue via the Core component. On the main Settings page,
enter the project filename and choose an output directory. Note: See
the? button in the dialogue for recommendations on the filename (which
characters to avoid).</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/assets/images/Kuka_prc_Output.jpg" title="File:Kuka_prc_Output.jpg" /></p>
<h3 id="start-position-end-position">Start Position / End Position<a class="headerlink" href="#start-position-end-position" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>When you work with robots there are certain issues you always have to
deal with: Reach: Can the robot's arms reach the entire workpiece?
Singularities: Will any joint positions result in singularities? (See
below for more on this topic) Joint Limits: During the motion of the
program will any of the axes hit their limits? One setting which has a
major impact on these is the Start Position. The program needs to know
how the tool is positioned before the motion starts. This value is VERY
important. That's because it establishes an initial placement for the
joint limits. Generally, you should choose a start position that doesn't
have any of the joints near their rotation limits - otherwise, your
programmed path may cause them to hit the joint limit. This is a really
common error. Make sure you aren't unintentionally near any of the axes
limits. Also, the robot will move from it's current position (wherever
that may be) to the start position. It could move right through your
workpiece or fixture setup. So make sure you are aware of where the
start position is, and make sure there's a clear path from the current
position of the robot to the start position. In other words, jog the
robot near to the start position to begin. That'll ensure the motion
won't hit your set up.</p>
<p>You specify these start and end position values in the Settings of the
Core. Bring up the settings dialog and choose the Advanced page.</p>
<p>Under the Start / Endposition section, you enter the axis values for A1
through A6. This begs the questions "how do I know what values to use?".</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/assets/images/kuka_prc_StartEndPositions.jpg" title="File:kuka prc_StartEndPositions.jpg" /></p>
<p>You can read these directly from the physical robot pendant. That is,
you jog the robot into a reasonable start position and read the values
from the pendant display. Enter the values into the dialog. Then do the
same for the End values. See the section Jogging the Robot in topic
Taubman College Agilus Workcell Operating Procedure.</p>
<p>You can also use KUKA|prc to visually set a start position and read the
axis values to use. To do this you wire in the KUKA|prc Axis component
into the Core component. You can "virtually jog" the robot to a specific
position using a setup like this:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/assets/images/kuka_prc_StartPositionSetup.jpg" title="File:kuka prc_StartPositionSetup.jpg" /></p>
<p>Then simply read the axis values from your sliders and enter these as
the Start Position or End Position.</p>
<p>Another way is to move the simulation to the start point of the path.
Then read the axis values from the Analysis output of the Core Settings
dialog. You can see the numbers listed from A01 to A06. Jot these down,
one decimal place is fine. Then enter them on the Advanced page.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/assets/images/kuka_prc_JointAnalysisValues.jpg" title="File:kuka prc_JointAnalysisValues.jpg" /></p>
<h3 id="initial-posture">Initial Posture<a class="headerlink" href="#initial-posture" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>Related to the Start Point is the Initial Posture setting. If you've set
the Start Position as above and are still seeing motion (like a big
shift in one of the axis to reorient) try the As Start option. This sets
the initial posture to match the start position.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/assets/images/InitialPosture.jpg" title="File:InitialPosture.jpg" /></p>
