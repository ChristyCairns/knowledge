<li>Do not use materials that are not suitable for laser cutting! Ask
    the FabLab operators if you're not sure about your material.</li>
<li>Do not stand on the side of the machine! Only in the front. The
    machine can move suddenly and quickly and can hit you.</li>
<li>Do not continue cutting if something is going wrong! For example:
    if there is flame or a lot of smoke or it's not cutting or the
    material is melting. Pause the machine and call a FabLab operator.</li>
<li>Do not change the material on the remote! It has to be "cardboard"
    always.</li>

<li>Plywood is a manufactured wood panel made from thin sheets of wood
    veneer. It is one of the most widely used wood products. It is
    flexible, inexpensive, workable, re-usable, and can usually be
    locally manufactured.</li>
<li>Medium-density fibreboard (MDF) is an engineered wood product formed
    by breaking down hardwood or softwood residuals into wood fibres,
    often in a defibrator, combining it with wax and a resin binder, and
    forming panels by applying high temperature and pressure. MDF is
    denser than plywood.</li>

<ul>
<li>1. Open EnRoute. If it's already open – go straight to step 2</li>
<li>2. Open a new file ( File - New ) and set your sheet size
    (width/heigh in mm, thickness is not important)</li>
<li>3. Import your .dxf file: File – Import – find your file</li>
<li>4. Make sure that your drawing is inside the red border. If you
    need to scale or move your drawing: select everything and press F2
    on the keyboard</li>
<li>5. Select everything and go to Transform – Merge selection… and
    click OK</li>
<li>6. If you are using two strategies (engraving and cutting) <a href="http://www.tabloidharga.com/tablet-murah">harga
    tablet terbaru</a> then go to
    Layers ( Setup - Layers ) and turn the engraving layer ON and the
    cutting layer OFF</li>
<li>7. Select all and click on the 'Engraving...' button (Toolpath -
    Engraving), in the drop-down menu select your Strategy – 'eng' and
    click OK. You will see the generated paths for your design</li>
<li>8. Go to Layers again and switch your cutting layer ON and the
    engraving one OFF</li>
<li>9. Select all and go to Engraving again but this time choose 'cut'
    in the drop-down menu</li>
<li>10. Switch all the layers ON. You will see all your paths together</li>
<li>11. Click the 'Output option' ( Machining - Output ) icon. Go to
    the 'Tool Order' section and make sure that 'engrave' is the first.
    If not – drag it up (click on the left box next to the number when
    the cursor will be an arrow to drag it up). If you have smaller
    pieces inside bigger pieces (holes, openings, etc.) then in 'Object
    Order' check 'Inside out'. Also check 'Small parts first'. Press 'To
    File'</li>
<li>12. Save your file inside 'Dnc files' folder. Use one of the
    existing folders (MAA, FabAcademy, etc.). You can also create your
    own folder</li>
<li>13. Done! Your file is sent to the machine</li>

<li>Bring your files in .dxf 2004 format so that you can import them
        directly to EnRoute.</li>
<li>You are not allowed to edit your files on this computer.</li>
<li>Do not open EnRoute multiple times, you can just open a new file
    in the same window.</li>
<li>If you have engraving and cutting you should have them in
    different layers.</li>
<li>Do not change material thickness.</li>
<li>All the dimensions are in millimeters. Your file units have to
    be millimeters.</li>
<li>If you have a grid put all the horizontal elements in one layer
    and all the vertical ones – in another.</li>
<li>If you are using AutoCAD or Grasshopper: use Rhino command
    'Make2D' in all your layers separately.</li>
<li>Your file has to be flat (on 0 in Z axis).</li>
<li>Your home is in the lower left edge of your sheet and has to be
    in 0, 0, 0.</li>
