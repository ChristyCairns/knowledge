<p>Laser settings for common materials - Epilog 75W</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Settings above are a good starting point. Laser cutting
quality is affected by several factors including lens cleanliness,
maintenance and/or aging laser tube. If you are not achieveing a cut,
try to increase the power, decrease the speed or a do combination of
both. Change settings with 5-10% step at a time.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you are not going to use the computer in the Fab Lab, <a href="http://www.buletinac.com/">Harga AC
    Murah</a>install the Epilog drivers in your
    computer (you can reach the machine inside the Fab Lab network).</li>
<li>Turn on the main fume extractor in the big laser cutter switch
    panel.</li>
<li>Turn on the small air compressor on the left hand side of the
    machine.</li>
<li>Turn on the laser cutter (left side of the machine).</li>
<li>Make sure the material <a href="http://www.buletinautomotif.com/">Harga Ban Motor
    Corsa</a> you want to use is in the
    'Materials and configuration' list. If it is not there, ask the Fab
    Lab responsible.</li>
<li>Measure the size of your material board.</li>
<li>From your vector editing software, once you are ready for printing
    and if you already installed the driver, press Ctrl+P or select
    'Print'.</li>
<li>Select 'Epilog Engraver' from the printer list and go to 'Printer
    settings' or 'Properties'.</li>
<li>The laser cutter driver interface should appear. Here you can set-up
    the laser's power and speed according to how the vector paths in
    your drawing are organized (you can also print raster images).
    <a href="http://www.buletinsamsung.com/">Harga HP Samsung</a></li>
<li>For a vector job:<ul>
<li>In the 'General' tab, under 'Job type' select 'Vector'.</li>
<li>Set the size of the material sheet under 'Piece Size'.</li>
<li>Set to 'Vector sorting' and 'Optimize'.</li>
<li>In the 'Color mapping' tab select the check box 'Color mapping'.
    You should have organized your drawing in different colors if
    you need to do different types of jobs (for example engraving
    and cutting).</li>
<li>Once this is activated, you can set the power, the speed, and
    other parameters for every single color in your drawing. Take a
    look at the 'Materials and configuration' list above for the
    proper power/speed values according to the material you are
    using.</li>
<li>The list order determines the execution sequence of every type
    of job. You should allays engrave first and cut later. You can
    change the order by selecting a color and pressing the up and
    down arrows.</li>
<li>Once you are done with this configuration, press 'OK'.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For a raster job:<ul>
<li>You should see the parts that you want to cut/engrave fitting
    the material in the preview. If not, you should scale, move,
    rotate or change the units of the drawing to get it as you want.</li>
<li>Finalize the process with 'Print' and the file will be sent to
    the laser cutter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At the machine:<ul>
<li>Open the hood and place the material on the metal bed without
    hitting the cutting head.</li>
<li>If the material you use is to thick (engraving bigger objects),
    you should lower the bed.<ul>
<li>To lower the bed:<ul>
<li>Press 'X/Y off' and bring the bed to the desired z
    position by pressing the 'up' and 'down' arrows.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Turn on the laser pointer 'Puntero'.</li>
<li>Set the machine head to the origin by pressing 'Restaur.' and
    focus the laser by pressing 'Enfocar' and 'GO/Entra'.<ul>
<li>If you want to change the x/y origin follow this steps:<ul>
<li>Press 'X/Y off' and bring the laser manually to the
    desire origin.</li>
<li>Then press 'Ajuste Inicio' and you should have now a new
    origin point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you already sent the job to the machine you will see 'Job:job
    name' in the display.</li>
<li>Pressing the up and down arrows will allow you to select the
    different jobs stored in the machine.</li>
<li>Press 'GO/Entra' to start cutting/engraving.</li>
<li>Press 'STOP/Salir' if something burns inside the machine or the
    material moves from its original position.</li>
<li>Don't leave the machine unattended.</li>
