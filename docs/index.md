# Welcome!

Welcome to the knowledge hub of Fablab Barcelona!

You might have visited this content in the past using [our wiki](https://wiki.fablabbcn.org). We have worked in a great refurbishment of this page and moved it here.

To help get you started, we have prepared these sections:

- [Education](educational programs): here we have compiled all the resources about our educational programs, such as the [Masters in Design for Emergent Futures](educational programs/MDEF) (MDEF), [Fabacademy](educational programs/fabacademy), [Fabriacademy](educational programs/fabriacademy) and more!
- [Machines and materials](machines and materials): from 3D printing to advanced robotics. Here we compile information about machines, materials, processes and some local and global suppliers.
- [Research areas](research areas): all our research activity compiled in a single spot, with links to specific project documentations and resources.
- [Tools](tools): some useful tools we use in our workflows, documented for anyone to use and benefit from.
- [WIP](WIP): _work in progress content_ - not categorised yet, but still useful
