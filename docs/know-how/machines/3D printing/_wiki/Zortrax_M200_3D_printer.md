## Health & Safety

Emissions testing from polymer filament desktop 3D printers found that
some plastic filament materials, when heated, were found to release
chemicals “known to be hazardous to health”, such as styrene and
isocyanates. These printers emit many particles that can potentially
enter the airways and lungs and should only be operated when enclosed by
a hood with a filtered ventilation system to reduce particle emission
rates by 97%.

# MATERIALS

## Zortrax Materials

Layer Plastic Deposition is a technology in which printer is melting
thermoplastic material (filament) in the extruder and apply it precisely
on heated platform layer after layer. Zortrax M200 dedicated printing
materials are: Z-ABS, Z-ULTRAT, Z-GLASS, Z-HIPS, Z-PCABS, Z-PETG, Z-ESD,
Z-ASA Pro, Z-PLA Pro, Zortrax M300: Z-HIPS, Z-PETG, Z-GLASS, Z-ESD,
Z-ASA Pro, Z-PLA Pro and Zortrax Inventure - Z-PLA, Z-PETG, Z-SUPPORT.

  - **Z-ULTRAT**: Z-ULTRAT is a versatile materials that lets you
    prototype models with features of products manufactured using
    injection moulding technology, all in-house. The strong, stable, and
    time-resistant material is available in a wide range of colours.
    Applications: functional prototypes end-use parts casing prototypes
    for testing end-use casing parts for low volume production
    prototypes of consumer products mechanical parts simulating
    properties of elements made in injection moulding elements required
    to be durable and stable over time

<!-- end list -->

  - **Z-HIPS**: Use Z-HIPS to significantly reduce warping and visibly
    shorten the time you’re spending on post-processing. The material
    has a unique mat structure that absorbs light and reduces the
    visibility of minor flaws. It’s great for printing bigger part,
    housing or architectural prototypes. Applications: models with
    large, flat surfaces architecture mockups casing elements for
    testing end-use casing parts for low volume production prototypes of
    consumer products prototypes of mechanical parts

<!-- end list -->

  - **Z-GLASS**: Translucent structures. Its light-transmitting surface
    makes it applicable in automotive, industrial design, and
    architecture projects. Applications: concept models that are to
    imitate glass or translucent plastic functional prototypes of
    translucent objects translucent decorative elements parts required
    to be resistant to salts, acids, alkalis, and solvents

<!-- end list -->

  - **Z-PETG**: Durable material. It’s highly resistant to salts, acids,
    and alkalis. The models will have a glossy surface that is also
    resistant to impact, time, and UV light. Applications: parts
    required being resistant to salts, acids, alkalis, and solvents
    machine components elements requiring resistance to greases and oils
    packaging prototypes prototypes of mechanical parts

<!-- end list -->

  - **Z-PCABS**: Z-PCABS emerged from combining two durable materials.
    Therefore it’s durable and impact resistant, suited for producing
    casings. It’s also resistant to temperatures, UV lights, and
    chemicals. The resistance made it a great material for automotive.
    Applications: consumer electronics casings automotive parts parts
    required to be resistant to temperature structural components

<!-- end list -->

  - **Z-ABS**: For printing concept models, mockups, gadgets, or
    figurines. Choose from a wide range of colours to catch the
    attention to your project. Applications: concept models gadgets and
    figurines display models models with moderate functional and testing
    properties

## External Materials

  - **PLA**: Polylactic acid is the quintessential material for 3d
    printing, thanks to its ease of use through deposition. It is
    recommended to begin in this type of manufacturing technology with
    this material. A great variety of colours exist and complex
    geometries can be achieved without great difficulty. The finish is
    slightly glossy or semi-matte.

Printing is carried out at temperatures ranging between 195º and 220° C,
depending on the supplier of the mate­rial and printing speed. A layer
fan is required to build overhangs. It easily attaches to the glass, and
if you work at a hotbed temperature ranging 45º C-55º C, no product is
required to ensure this adherence. The mechanical properties are
average, but presents a certain fragility in parts requiring
deformation, from a tempe­rature of about 50 °, the parts can present
it. It is dissolved in caustic soda.

  - **ABS**: Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene is one of the most widely
    used materials in 3d printing, and makes up for some of the
    weaknesses of the PLA. Printing with ABS is more complex and
    requires some attention. ABS is not recom­mended for inexperienced
    users. The variety of colours is also very high and the finish is
    semi-matte or matte.

The ABS is printed at temperatures between 210º C and 240º C depending
on the supplier of the material and prin­ting speed. The ABS performs
better with overhangs, and needs less air into the fan layer (excess air
can be harmful). Adherence to the platform is weaker than with the PLA,
due to material shrinkage on cooling, and often requires adhesive
coating despite working with a hotbed temperature of 70 ° C. If the
geometry of the piece to be printed has a too large base, is further
promotes adherence problem due to the large lift effect that occurs at
the opposite ends of the workpiece (known as warping).

  - **Filaflex**: Filaflex is a flexible material that comes in
    different colors.

Requires the use of a 0.6 mm nozzle. Speed 10mm/s Temperature 235ºC
Hodbed 40ºC

# WORKFLOW

## STL File Preparation

STL is the standard file type used by most additive manufacturing
systems. STL is a triangulated representation of a 3D CAD model. The
triangulation (or poly count) of a surface will cause faceting of the 3D
model. The parameters used for outputting a STL will affect how much
faceting occurs. You cannot build the model smoother than the STL file.
If the STL is coarse and faceted the physical 3D printed model will be
coarse and faceted as well. However, the smoother/ less faceted your
surface is, (the higher the poly count or triangulation) the larger your
file. 3D printing can only accept a certain file size; therefore it’s
important to find a balance between your model, its desired surface, and
the 3D printing process of your choice.

Important: STL files are suitable for 3D printing only if the models
they describe are “watertight”, that is, they do not contain holes or
gaps. To check to see if your mesh is watertight, follow the steps
below:

`   1. Convert file to MESH`
`      -Select Object`
`      -Convert to Mesh by typing command 'MESH'`
`      -Select Polygon Count > The higher the polygon count, the smoother the surface finish`
`   2. Check the MESH for any errors`
`      -Type 'CHECKMESH' to check mesh object for errors and problems, which include:`
`        • Degenerate faces - Fix with the CullDegenerateMeshFaces command.`
`        • Zero length edges - Zero-length edges typically are the result of degenerate faces. Fix with the CullDegenerateMeshFaces command.`
`        • Non-manifold edges - Use the CullDegenerateMeshFaces command and then fix with the ExtractNonManifoldMeshEdges command.`
`        • Naked edges - Naked edges can cause problems with rapid prototyping.`
`          Use the ShowEdges command to help find them or set the display mode to paint them a different color.`
`          Try the FillMeshHole, FillMeshHoles, or MatchMeshEdge commands to remove naked edges.`
`          If the mesh is still open, try the WELD Command.`
`          The Weld command will merge adjacent triangle points when 180 angle tolerance is set`
`        • Duplicate faces - Fix with the ExtractDuplicateMeshFaces command.`
`        • Faces with reversed normals. Fix with the UnifyMeshNormals command.`
`        • Disjoint pieces - Fix with the SplitDisjointMesh command.`
`        • Unused vertices - Unused vertices do not usually cause a problem, and there are no commands to for removing them in Rhino.`
`          Specific details on these commands can be found in the Rhino Help file.`
`   3. Once the mesh is watertight, it is ready to be exported.`
`      -File > Save As`
`      -Select File Type as STL`
`      -Select File Name > Save`
`      -Select Binary`
`      -As for the other settings, always select the standard options`
`      -Click OK`

## Z-SUITE Software Manual

Zortrax Z-SUITE software is created specifically for Zortrax machines.
Z-SUITE allows opening a .stl, .obj or .dxf file and set printing
preferences. It is the only 3D printing software in which users are able
to convert 2D files into 3D models and cut models directly in Z-SUITE
software. It is dedicated for both Windows and Mac users. Zortrax
developed an application for storing and downloading 3D models - the
Zortrax Library. It is available in both Z-SUITE and online. Before
starting, download the Z-SUITE here:
<http://support.zortrax.com/downloads/>

1.  **Printer Selection:** On Z-Suite start screen, select the model of
    the printer you are going to use.
2.  **Adding a Model:** Use + icon or use drag and drop option to upload
    a model. You may do so with models saved in an .stl or an .obj
    format. Select a model and click OPEN.
3.  **Editing a Model:** There are several options to manipulate or edit
    your model in Z-suite including Splitting, Rotating, Resizing,
    Moving, or Duplicating a model, all of which can be found on the
    left-hand side of the window.
4.  **Preparing to Print:** If your model is ready to be printed, click
    “Print.” Set printing options: PROFILE/LAYER
    THICKNESS/SPEED/INFILL which are explained below.
5.  **Print Settings:**
    1.  **Normal Settings**
          -
            **Layer thickness:** choose the height of one layer:
            0,09mm/0,14mm/0,19mm/0,29mm/0,39mm (depending on the
            material). Finer layers provide better surface quality but
            make printing more time- and material-consuming.
            **Quality (previously Speed):** HIGH/NORMAL. High quality
            gives better looking prints but increases the printing time.
            **Infill:** Choose the model infill:
            MAXIMUM/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW. All four types of infill are
            presented in the picture on the right. MAXIMUM infill allows
            printing with the highest strength level. But the larger
            infill, the more time and material is needed for such a
            print.
            **Support:** Select the angle at which the support structure
            is generated. 20° is the default option. It means that for
            all hanging parts of the model the support structure is
            generated at a 20° angle.
            **Support Lite:** Choose this option to generate the support
            structure without the outer perimeter. Support lite consumes
            less material and it is easier to remove.
            **Print Cooling:** You can choose the fan speed which cools
            down the model that is being printed. Cooling is not useful
            for big prints without any thin parts, whereas high cooling
            is better for small and thin prints. We recommend leaving
            the default option – AUTO. The printer will adjust the fan
            speed accordingly.
    2.  **Advanced Settings**
          -
            **Seam:** It allows you to choose the starting point of
            every new layer (normal or random)
            **Surface Layers:** If you aim at achieving a thicker
            finishing of the model, use this function. It helps you to
            choose the amount of layers at the top and at the bottom
            **Offset:** this option helps to correct the internal and
            external dimensions of a model (in millimeters). It is
            possible to modify outer contours and holes dimension,
            however, only in the X and Y axis.
            **Infill Advanced:**
            \-MESH Prints the model with 0% infill with horizontal
            surfaces (top and bottom) and the walls
            \-SHELL Prints the model with 0% infill and no top and
            bottom surface layers. This option allows to choose the
            amount of the model wall. If you want the bottom layer to be
            printed, check the BOTTOM surface layer box while choosing
            SHELL infill.
            \-There is a SPIRAL MODE available with SHELL option. If you
            choose this option, your model will be printed with no seam.
6.  **Saving the Z-Code:** Once the .zcode has been generated, your
    model is ready to be saved on the SD card. Information about your
    print: profile, layer thickness, infill as well as an estimated
    print time and material usage will be shown at the bottom of the
    screen. Save your .zcode on a hard drive or directly on the SD card
    by clicking “Save to print” button. Insert the SD card into the
    printer and start printing.

**LARGE PRINTS** The problem of warping is frequent with large prints.
Bigger models often shrink and that’s why they do not stick to the
platform while printing. Additionally, it is better to choose low
density of infill (medium or light) or, if low density is problematic,
choose mesh option. For large prints with no precise details the optimum
layer thickness is 0,19mm or 0,29mm.

**PRINTING SMALL OBJECTS** Very small objects require some additional
options such as the appropriate FAN SPEED and LAYER THICKNESS. Set the
lowest possible layer thickness and the additional FAN SPEED to 80-100%.

**PRINTING MOVEBLE PARTS** While printing movable parts, it is important
to keep proper spaces between particular parts. The minimum space
requirement is 0.4mm for these kinds of prints.
