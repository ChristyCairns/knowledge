**Description**:

A jigsaw power tool is a jigsaw made up of an electric motor and a
reciprocating saw blade.

Jigsaws are ideal for cutting curves and complex shapes in wood. They
also work well for making short crosscuts on a board and finishing
inside corner cuts. Jigsaws are not good for making fast, long, straight
cuts. Use a circular saw instead.

In the past, what is now usually called scroll saws were often referred
to as jigsaws. A power jigsaw may also be referred to, by some
manufacturers, as a "bayonet saw" or sabre saw.

## Safety

  - Use always safety glasses
  - Change the blade with the machine umplugged and not in direction of
    your face.
  - Check that the cutting line does not pass over the work table.(don't
    hit the table with the blade)
  - The electric cable must extend on the opposite side of the cutting
    direction

## How to use

  - Used for free shapes
  - Choose the right blade. Depending on the material, the thickness and
    the maximum angle of the cutting curve
  - The blade have to be at least 1 cm longer than the thickness of
    material
  - Donâ€™t change the T shape blade in direction of your face, lie down
    the tool and change the blade
  - Use a fence for perfectly straight cuts. Hold the workpiece and the
    fence firmly with clamps.
  - Avoid driving blades into the bench top.
  - With hardwood use slow speed (to much friction can burn the
    material)
  - With softwood can use fast speed
