Programs.

\--- Check the "Show updates" box.

\--- Scroll to the bottom of the window, and locate the patch to
un-install. Microsoft labels the patches here by their corresponding

## Maintenance

This milling machine should be checked at least once a month, when is
frequently used please check it weekly

  - Keep the machine clean
  - Make sure that all the best are tight and with no broken teeth
  - Grease the bushes with machine grease (at the lab), put grease in
    each one of the bushes by putting the tip in the nipple (see pic 1)
