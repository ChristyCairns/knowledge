A **stepper motor** (or **step motor**) is a
[brushless](Brushless_DC_electric_motor "wikilink"), synchronous
[electric motor](electric_motor "wikilink") that can divide a full
rotation into a large number of steps. The motor's position can be
controlled [precisely](accuracy_and_precision "wikilink") without any
feedback mechanism (see [Open-loop
controller](Open-loop_controller "wikilink")), as long as the motor is
carefully sized to the application. Stepper motors are similar to
[switched reluctance motors](Reluctance_motor "wikilink") (which are
very large stepping motors with a reduced pole count, and generally are
closed-loop commutated.)
