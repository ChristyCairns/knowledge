\*After verifying the mesh, open your STL file and scale your object to
be certain it fit into the cube.
Advice : always upload your file at netfabb cloud service before
importing it on formlabs and make sure that you have preform software
updated.

\*Then, adjust the orientation by clicking on "orient selected". Thus
the software give you the correct printable direction of your object. Do
not hesitate to play with the orientation of the piece to optimize the
material waist. ![](/assets/images/F3.png "700 × 402 pixels")

If a red task appears that means it will not print correctly. Do it
again, or manually.
\*Generate the support of your object. The red data (on the following
picture) are those whhich will allow you to optimize the quantity of
used resin according to your piece. ![](/assets/images/F4.png

\*Position the objects that you wish to print in a way they are not
piled.
\*If you are certain that is the correct resin, then print\!

## Post-Print Steps


NB : always use NITRILE GLOVES\!

1\. Remove the build platform
Always remove the build platform before removing the resin tank to avoid
dripping leftover material into the printer body.
2\. Use the scraper to remove print
3\. Rinse part in Isopropyl Alcohol
Cover the rinse tub, shake for 2 minutes and let your part soak for 10
minutes. If you leave it more it will dissolve.

After each print, clean excess resin from the build platform and return
it to the Form 1+. Leaving a wet build platform on the accessory kit
makes it very hard to clean later.

## Issues While Printing

[Formlabs Official
Website](http://formlabs.com/support/troubleshooting/issues-while-printing/)

Below are a few known issues that can occur while your part is printing.
Use the advice to minimize print process problems.

### Part Falls from Supports

If a part detaches from its supports during a print, you may need to
strengthen the support contact using the advanced support settings.

point size and/or the support structure density.

### Part Doesn't Adhere to the Build Platform

Monitor your prints from time to time to make sure they're adhering to
the build platform correctly. If you realize the print has failed,
simply cancel the print by holding the Form 1 button for 3 seconds, then
clean the cured material from the printer. To resolve adherence issues,
increase the base thickness or use the fine tuning setting to adjust the
height of the build platform.

### Printer Stops Mid-print

If your printer stops a print before finishing, try the following:

  - Double-check that your printer power supply is securely plugged in
    and that you don’t have any electrical interruptions.
  - Allow the entire print file to transfer from your computer to the
    Form 1+ before disconnecting the USB cable. The file transfer can
    take several minutes. Disconnecting too early will result in an
    incomplete model.
  - Check whether the cover is completely closed and recognized by the
    printer.

### Printer Unplugged During File Transfer

  - Make sure the same instance of PreForm Software is still open.
  - Plug the printer back in to resume the file transfer.
  - If PreForm Software was closed, you can reload your saved scene and
    re-start the transfer.

## Maintenance

## Mirror Cleaning Instructions

It's critical that you use only PEC\*PADs for your mirror cleaning, as
they're the only product we've found thus far that doesn't damage the
delicate surface of the Form 1(+) mirrors.
Instructions:
1\) Can you inspect the large mirror with a light as depicted here? It
should be completely free of all dust particles or smudges. Any blockage
in the optical path can affect how the laser performs, and how your
final print turns out.
2\) Please clean the mirror, following the instructions here.
3\) Please send me a photo of the mirror afterwards, duplicating the
low-angle lighting shown in the mirror checking article.
4\) Please clean the small mirror and galvo mirrors as depicted in the
attached "Galvo Mirror Cleaning.pdf".
