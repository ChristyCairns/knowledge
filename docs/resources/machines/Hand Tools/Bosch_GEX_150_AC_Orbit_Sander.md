**Description**:

The orbital sander allows for smooth, scratch free finish on plane wood
board.

It is simply a sander that moves the sanding media in a circle (spinning
it) while at the same time moving the entire pad in a slightly oval
orbit around the center of the sanders z axis. Simply put the sander
keeps the sanding particles from making contact with the same section of
wood over and over, resulting in a more uniform finish.

## Safety

  - Use the mask
  - When you turn on the machine keep it up from the surface
  - When you turn off the machine let it come to a complete stop before
    placing it on the table

## How to use

  - Before you begin sanding, make sure the disk of the sander has
    proper sandpaper attached and with the ideal grain
  - Make sure that the sandpaper already on the sander does still have
    grit; if it is too used, replace it before sanding
  - As usual, make sure that the material you are sanding is in a vice,
    or securely clamped to a table
  - When you turn the sander on, make sure you let it spin up to full
    speed before making contact with the material.
  - Don't press down on the sander. The weight of the sander and your
    arm will cause enough pressure to get the job done.
  - Cover all rough surfaces of the material until the edges have been
    thoroughly smoothed and you have removed all splinters.
  - Lift the sander off of the material before allowing it to slow down/
    turn off.

  - Good finishing,
  - No big marks on the wood,
