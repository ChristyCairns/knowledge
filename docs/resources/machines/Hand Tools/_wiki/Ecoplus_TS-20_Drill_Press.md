**Description**:

A drill press is a style of drill that may be mounted on a stand or
bolted to the floor or workbench.

Major components include a base, column (or pillar), adjustable table,
spindle, chuck, and drill head, usually driven by an electric motor. The
head has a set of three handles radiating from a central hub that are
turned to move the spindle and chuck vertically.

## Safety

  - Use always glasses and if you're drilling metal, gloves are
    required.
  - The ro­tation of the drill bit may try to spin the wood or metal
    workpiece, so it must be clamped to the worktable.

## How to use

  - Tool to drill wood, metal and plastic

  - Fit the Bit. Open the chuck, slide in the bit, snug the chuck by
    hand around the bit’s shaft, then tighten.

  - Adjust the Table. Release the clamping lever on the back of the
    platform and turn the crank on the right side to adjust the table
    height.

## Advantages

A drill press has a number of advantages over a hand-held drill:

  - Less effort is required to apply the drill to the workpiece.
  - The movement of the chuck and spindle is by a lever working on a
    rack and pinion, which gives the operator considerable mechanical
    advantage
  - The table allows a vise or clamp to be used to position and restrain
    the work, making the operation much more secure
  - The angle of the spindle is fixed relative to the table, allowing
    holes to be drilled accurately and consistently
  - Drill presses are almost always equipped with more powerful motors
    compared to hand-held drills. This enables larger drill bits to be
    used and also speeds up drilling with smaller bits.
